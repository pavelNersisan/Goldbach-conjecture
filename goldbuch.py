    print("The approach used in this code follows the general idea of checking if an even number can be represented as the sum of two prime numbers by iterating through all possible combinations. This method is effective for smaller ranges of even numbers, but it becomes computationally expensive for larger ranges due to the need to check each even number individually.")
    print("While this method does not provide a definitive proof of Goldbach's conjecture, it can be used to gain insights into the behavior of even numbers and their representation as the sum of two prime numbers. The heuristic justification suggests that the conjecture is highly likely to be true, even though a formal mathematical proof remains elusive.")
