# Goldbach-conjecture
Overview
The Goldbach conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics that states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This project aims to implement a program that verifies the Goldbach conjecture up to a given limit, providing a means to explore and study this fascinating mathematical problem.

Features
Checks the Goldbach conjecture for even integers up to a user-specified limit.
Displays the number of even integers that satisfy the Goldbach conjecture within the given range.
Provides detailed information about the Goldbach conjecture, including its history and current status.
Allows users to generate and export data related to the Goldbach conjecture for further analysis.
Installation
To use this program, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/pavelNersisan/Goldbach-conjecture.git
cd Goldbach-conjecture
Then, follow the instructions in the README file to build and run the program.

Usage
The program can be run from the command line with the following options:

./goldbach_checker --limit <number>
Replace <number> with the desired upper limit for the even integers to be checked. The program will then output the number of even integers that satisfy the Goldbach conjecture within the specified range.
